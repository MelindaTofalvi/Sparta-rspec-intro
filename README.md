# Euler Problem 1 & 2

## Objective

Unit testing, TDD, Rspec

## Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Instructions

Here you can follow the below steps to run the test:
1. Clone the above Git repo to your computer
2. Using your terminal, navigate to the 'rspec_project_euler' folder
3. Within this folder navigate to either Problem 1 or Probplem 2
4. within that folder run the 'rspec' command
5. you should get '4 examples, 0 failures' for Problem 1, and '3 examples, 0 failures' for Problem 2

# Rspec Intro

## Objective

Unit testing, TDD, Rspec

## Summary

Creating an rspec file with some test in it. Used variables to run the tests. 
To check which method to use, we used Documentation.
